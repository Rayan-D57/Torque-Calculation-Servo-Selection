Torque Calculation and Servo Selection Project

Description:
This project aims to calculate the torque required to move a robotic arm or any other mechanical system, and to select the appropriate servo motor based on these calculations. Torque is the rotational force required to move an object around an axis, and is a critical factor in the design of mechanical systems.

Main Components:
- Torque Calculator: A program or tool to calculate the required torque based on the weight, length, and angle of movement of the arm.
- Servo Motors: A set of servo motors with different torques to choose from.
- Robotic Arm: A model of a robotic arm or any other mechanical system to be tested.

How it works:
1. Torque Calculation: The required torque is calculated using physical equations that take into account the weight, length, and angle of movement of the arm.
2. Servo Selection: Based on the calculated torque, the servo motor that provides the appropriate torque is selected.
3. Testing: The robotic arm is tested with the selected motor to ensure that it is working properly and efficiently.
